    <h1>Food Storage Preparedness</h1>
    <br>
    <p id="description">Food storage preparedness is often something many overlook. It's actually incredibly important to be prepared for whatever
      situation might occur. Maybe you just need some food and a small kit for a 72h emergency. Or maybe you're trying to prepare for
      for a longer term emergency like becoming unemployeed. Either way, you're going to have to prepare a food supply. This webpage is
      an interactive website designed to provide you all the information you would need to know to build your 72 kit, a short term food
      supply and a long term food supply. There's also a built in interactive checklist so that you can know all the items you might need
      to prepare!
