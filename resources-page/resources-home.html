    <h3>Short-term food storage.</h3>
  Short-term food storage is basically an expanded grocery list. Take the amount of food you would purchase for your family for a day and multiply that by 7. This is equal to a one week supply. Once you have a week’s supply, you can expand it from there up to eventually 3 months.
  A couple of ways to start your short term storage is buying a few extra items and add it to your grocery list. Another method is to look at and plan meals, then buy ingredients accordingly. You also want to have ingredients for a few simple meals that don’t require much preparation. This will allow you to have convenience without using a lot of resources. Box meals are also quite useful.

  <h3>Long-term food storage</h3>
  Long-term food storage involves gradually building a supply of food and ingredients that last a long time and will help you beyond 3 months. Some examples are, wheat, white rice, and beans. These items, when stored properly, can last 30 years. Proper storage involves keeping these foods in a dry place at a temperature of 75F/24C lower.
  Bottles of PETE plastic can be used with oxygen absorbers for long-term storage as well. Make sure to use bottles that have screw-on lids with plastic or rubber seals. Make sure the bottles are protected from light and rodents. Make sure you also know and mark the shelf life of your longer-term items. For example: cooking oils have a shelf like of about a year. Make sure to use and rotate these items so they don’t spoil. Make sure to have a supply of vitamin C as well.

  <h3>Water Storage</h3>
  Water storage is both something that is long-term and short-term. The average person will need 1 gallon of water per day for survival. PET food-grade plastic containers are the best. Make sure all containers are cleaned and sanitized. A solution can be created by adding 1tsp of bleach to 1 liter of water. Make sure to have smaller bottles for your 72 hour kit and larger ones for long-term food storage.
  Water from a municipal water supply does not need further treatment when stored properly. Non-chlorinated water needs to be treated with bleach. 8 drops per 1 gallon. There are also commercial filters available as well. Containers should be emptied and refilled regularly. Water should be stored away from light and heat and freezing.

  <h3>Useful Webpages for additional information</h3>
  There are a lot of useful webpages out there for getting additional information on food storage preparedness. Some may have information regarding how to properly store your food and water, others contianing information on what items you might need and want. There's so many different places in which items can be purchased. Below are some links to where you can find more information, or begin shopping for the items you need.
