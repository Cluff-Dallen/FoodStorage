      <h3>Short-term food storage.</h3>
      <p> Short-term food storage is basically an expanded grocery list. Take the amount of food you would purchase for your family for a day and multiply that by 7. This is equal to a one week supply. Once you have a week’s supply, you can expand it
        from there up to eventually 3 months. <br> A couple of ways to start your short term storage is buying a few extra items and add it to your grocery list. Another method is to look at and plan meals, then buy ingredients accordingly. You also
        want to have ingredients for a few simple meals that don’t require much preparation. This will allow you to have convenience without using a lot of resources. Box meals are also quite useful.</p>

      <br>

      <p> Ideally, you'd want to try try to find food and items that are low in cost. When preparing a 72h kit, you never know what kind of situation it might be used for so it can be intimidating trying to determaine what items your kit should
        include.
        Many preppers and researchers have advised that it is wise to have high calorie items added to your 72h kit as that when you need it, your following 72h might just require a lot of energy in which you would need these calories for! Another
        tip
        I would suggest is that you try to avoid having items that require being cooked. When your in a hurry because of this possible emergency, you likely won't have much time to cook, nor would you want to have to carry around a stove if you
        didn't
        have to. I would reccomend something quick and easy to eat, so that you can continue taking care of other important tasks. Another important thing to consider when trying to choose what items to add and this also applies to long term food
        storage, choose items that you and or your family will enjoy! When you're given the option, choose something that you won't be discusted with. This is the food your stuck with for the next couple days, so make sure it tastes good for you! And
        lastly you'll want to avoid anything that would require refrigeration, but this one should be pretty obvious!

      <h3>Long-term food storage</h3>
      <p>Long-term food storage involves gradually building a supply of food and ingredients that last a long time and will help you beyond 3 months. Some examples are, wheat, white rice, and beans. These items, when stored properly, can last 30
        years. Proper storage involves keeping these foods in a dry place at a temperature of 75F/24C lower. Bottles of PETE plastic can be used with oxygen absorbers for long-term storage as well. Make sure to use bottles that have screw-on
        lids with plastic or rubber seals. Make sure the bottles are protected from light and rodents. Make sure you also know and mark the shelf life of your longer-term items. For example: cooking oils have a shelf like of about a year. Make sure
        to use and rotate these items so they don’t spoil. Make sure to have a supply of vitamin C as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="information-item-container">
      <h3>Water Storage</h3>
      <p> Water storage is both something that is long-term and short-term. The average person will need 1 gallon of water per day for survival. PET food-grade plastic containers are the best. Make sure all containers are cleaned and sanitized. A
        solution can be created by adding 1tsp of bleach to 1 liter of water.<br>Make sure to have smaller bottles for your 72 hour kit and larger ones for long-term food storage. Water from a municipal water supply does not need further treatment
        when stored properly. Non-chlorinated water needs to be treated with bleach. 8 drops per 1 gallon. There are also commercial filters available as well. Containers should be emptied and refilled regularly. Water should be stored away from
        light and heat and freezing.</p>

      <br>

      <p>When storing water to prepare for an emergency, it's important to have some ready to go. Like previously meantioned it's reccomended to have roughly 1 gallon per person, per day. But depending on living situations, storing water can be
        difficult. Maybe you are tight on space, or money, or you're trying to plan to have enough water to last a few years. Everyone's situation is different, but fortunately there are many options avalible for us. Depending on your needs you can
        find small water storage containers that hold 5-10 gallons or so, or you can find something much larger like a 50 gallon barrel. You've got the option for a small water filter that is light weight and protable that can filter up to a 100,000
        gallons that functions similarly to a straw, or you can choose to do a much larger pump that filters much more that is a bit more convient. There's the option of cleaning your water with purification tablets, or even boiling your water. It's
        important to know your options, and to determaine what works best for you. And when keeping emergencies in mind, consider a backup option/plan!</p>

      <br>

      <h3>Other useful info:</h3>
      <p>The challenging part about preparing for an emergancy is that everyone's situation may be different. Of course there's specific things that everyone should have, but it's important to understand that it's a very personal and customizable
        task
        as well. When preparing your 72h kit and your long term food storage, consider what needs you and your family may have. Keep allergies, and personal health issues in mind. Think of any medication you might require. Do you have an infant at
        home? Maybe you need to add diapers, wipes, forumla to the list. Do you need to ordrer some additional contacts? Products for feminine needs? You might want maps of your local area, or more water than the average person due to your climate.
        If
        you're in a cold climate you may want to have packed some winter gear, if your in hotter climate maybe things like sunscreen or a hat. Again it's very personalizable and can be tailored to your specific needs.
